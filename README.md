### Problem Domain

The goal for today is to deploy a simple Node.js server to EC2, using Elastic Beanstalk.

1. **Choose a server you’ve built previously**:
   - Option 1: A simple API or Web Server
   - Option 2: A socket.io event Hub
The server should not require a database.
Check in your server to GitHub.

2. **Task 1**:

   - Create a new environment, using Elastic Beanstalk from the AWS Control Panel (GUI)
   Manually deploy your application to this environment by uploading a .zip file

3. **Task 2**:

   - Using the same server, create a new environment using Elastic Beanstalk from your terminal
Manually deploy your application to this environment by using eb deploy
